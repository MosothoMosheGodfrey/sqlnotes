\section{Objective}
The objective is to extract SQL query codes from the \texttt{sys.dm\_exec\_sql\_text} dynamic management function in SQL Server using Python's \texttt{pyodbc} library. This involves retrieving the text of SQL batches identified by specific \texttt{sql\_handle}s, which can be obtained from the \texttt{sys.dm\_exec\_requests} dynamic management view.

\section{Detailed View using Pyodbc}
To accomplish this task using Python's \texttt{pyodbc} library, the process typically involves several steps. First, establish a connection to the SQL Server instance using \texttt{pyodbc.connect()} method, providing necessary connection parameters such as server name, database name, username, and password. Then, execute a SQL query against the \texttt{sys.dm\_exec\_requests} view to retrieve active requests and their corresponding \texttt{sql\_handle}s. Utilize \texttt{cursor.execute()} method to perform this query. Iterate through the result set using cursor objects to obtain \texttt{sql\_handle}s. For each \texttt{sql\_handle}, execute another SQL query against \texttt{sys.dm\_exec\_sql\_text} to fetch the corresponding SQL text. Use \texttt{cursor.fetchall()} or related methods to obtain the SQL text result set. Process the retrieved SQL text within the Python environment as needed, such as performing analysis or logging. Finally, close the cursor and connection objects using \texttt{cursor.close()} and \texttt{connection.close()} methods to release resources. This systematic approach enables seamless extraction and manipulation of SQL query codes from SQL Server using \texttt{pyodbc} in Python.

\section{Importance of SQL Text for Building a Library}
Building a library that catalogs SQL query codes can be immensely beneficial for developers, database administrators, and analysts. Such a library serves as a valuable resource for reference, learning, and troubleshooting purposes. By documenting and organizing SQL query codes, developers can easily reuse or adapt existing queries, saving time and effort in development tasks. Database administrators can use the library to optimize and tune database performance by analyzing commonly used queries and identifying areas for improvement. Additionally, analysts can leverage the library to understand data access patterns, track changes, and ensure data integrity. Moreover, a well-maintained SQL query library fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members, contributing to better productivity and efficiency in database-related tasks.

\section{Enhancing the Library with AI}
Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities can significantly enhance the functionality and usefulness of the SQL query library. AI algorithms can analyze the historical usage patterns of SQL queries, identifying frequently used or highly efficient queries. This analysis can help prioritize queries for documentation and optimization, ensuring that the most impactful queries are readily accessible to users. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be employed to extract meaningful metadata from SQL queries, such as their purpose, input parameters, and expected outputs. This metadata enriches the documentation of SQL queries, providing users with additional context and facilitating easier navigation and understanding. Furthermore, AI-powered recommendation systems can suggest relevant queries based on user behavior, preferences, and context, improving the discoverability and usability of the library. Overall, leveraging AI technologies can make the SQL query library smarter, more intuitive, and more valuable to its users.
